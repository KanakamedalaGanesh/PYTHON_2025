PARADIGM:[Paradigm means breaking large program into small parts for better readability and solving.]
#Paradigm means a set of rules and principles that guide the design and implementation of a programming language.
#Python is an object-oriented language, which means it supports the concept of objects and classes.
#It also supports procedural programming, which means it supports the concept of procedures and functions.
